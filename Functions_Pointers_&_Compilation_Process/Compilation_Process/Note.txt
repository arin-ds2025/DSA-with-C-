Preprocessor directives in C++ are special commands that begin with a hash sign (#) 
and are processed by the preprocessor before the actual compilation of the source code.
They are not part of the C++ language itself, but rather instructions to the preprocessor, 
which is a separate tool or component of the compiler. 
The preprocessor's role is to modify the source code based on these directives,
producing an intermediate file that the compiler then uses to generate machine code.

IN terminal..(VS code terminal or Git Bash). (for Windows,, cause C++ is a platform dependent language):

we can know the directory files list by  ls  commands
we can swtich in any existant folder in a folder by cd commands

we can create compiler by g++ file_name.cpp .. it will create a default execusion file named a.execusion
we can set the executable_file name using -o flag..
example: g++ file_name -o executable file name

then we we can run the code by ./executable_file_name.exe
we can create and run the compiler in one line using && 
example: g++ file_name.cpp -o executable_file_name && ./executable_file_name.exe

we can change the compile version while we create a compailer for that file
example: g++ file_name.cpp -o executable_file_name --std=c++14

we can see the header or preprocessor directive codes in terminal, using -E flag
example: g++ -E file_name.cpp

we can store the heard or preprocessor directive's code to a new file, using > operator  (it's called preprocessor extension)
example: g++ -E file_name.cpp > new_file_name.cpp 

we can see the assembly language of our code by using -S flag
example: g++ -S file_name.cpp   . it'll create a new file namede file_name.S

we can control the optimization the assembly language in 3 levels, these are:
-O1 (lowest optimization), -O2(medium optimization), -O3(higest optimization) .. there are captital O , not 0
example: g++ -S -O2 file_name.cpp

we can direct optimizely create our compile using that levels:
example: g++ -O3 file_name.cpp

we can see the file size by ls -lh
those files, who has small size , those are more optimized
